After unfolding, we can train the RNN the way we train ANNs without loops. A picture illustrating the concept of unfolding.

Unfolding	What should we do when we want to train an RNN? <please input your answer>	Training an RNN. Training an RNN by using backpropagation is more complicated than training an ANN with no loops. Unfolding: The loops are removed by duplicating parts of the neural network whenever they represent different parts of the sentence. After unfolding, we can train the RNN the way we train ANNs without loops. A picture illustrating the concept of unfolding.

In an SOFM, what happens to the map if one kind of input is given more frequently than others? <please input your answer>	Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM). SOFM learns to create a neural map: Similar inputs are placed in nearby locations. Inputs presented more frequently occupy more areas. The more a specific type of input is seen, the more minute differences among the inputs belonging to that type are represented in the map. It contains a picture of SOFM.

The network is called a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) because it has a loop in the connection to feed the previous activations back to the input. This network receives one word at a time and is trained to generate an output each time using supervised learning with additional 'desired outputs'. Another usage: They can also be trained to represent phrases and sentences. A picture of RNN.
